# Houston_Stockpile
Flew a Phantom 4 over a stockpile in Memorial Park located in Houston.
The application used to plan the mission was DroneDeploy in this project.
This orthomosaic was processed overnight in dronedeploy to find the analytical tools available in the application.
Pix4DMapper was used also to stich an Orthomosaic.
An Elevation map was obtained also from DronDeploy.
